# Reservations

## Frontend
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

```bash
yarn start #Starts the development server.
```

```bash
yarn build #Bundles the app into static files for production.
```

```bash
yarn test #Starts the test runner.
```

```bash
yarn eject #Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
```

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn start
```
